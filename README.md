# LogicReasoningProblem

In this logic question, you are standing in a room with three light switches. The switches all correspond to three different light bulbs in an adjacent room that you cannot see into. With all the light switches starting in the off position, how can you find out which switch connects to which light bulb?

I would flip two switches on, leave them on for a good while, flip them off and go check which two bulbs are warm. The one that is cold is the one that is in the off position. I would then wait until the light bulbs cool down adn then repeat the process using the one that was cold and one of the ones that was warm to tell me the other two bulbs.
